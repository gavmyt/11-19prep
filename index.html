    D3 outlines do not actually lay out anything for you, but rather change and transform your data and generate new data that is
    more convenient to use. I think they are best for you when you need a different and unique way to represent a dataset. Maybe you think
    that a specific visualization would best be used to represent a specific dataset/type of dataset. I also think the data that is best
    represented using these first 3 D3 outlines is data that can be easily translated into a data set, so you need that data that can be
    easily interpreted by differing sizes and/or color (especially with these 3). These first 3 data sets give you simple visualizations
    so I think the data needs to be able to apply to it.
